# Projects with Underserved Communities: India
PUC India is a humanitarian engineering organization at UT Austin that partners with underserved communities in India to provide crucial infrastructure and projects. 
The current team is designing, funding, and constructing an 806 square foot Multipurpose Community Center for the village of Siripudi in Andhra Pradesh, India.

This website was built from scratch for the PUC 2019-2020 and 2020-2021 teams using Gridsome and hosted on Github Pages. Google Analytics has also been integrated for
tracking engagement and outreach campaigns.
